# WBRAutomation


Uses a SQLite DB for netflix enagemnet metrics (I used kaggle to get a csv of the data and loaded it to my local SQLite DB)

This program automates the WBR process by successfully 
- drafting an outlook email with placeholder content and WBR charts in the email body

Just run the "draftWBREmail" file and you are good to go...
